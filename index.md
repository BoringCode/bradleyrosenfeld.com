<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Bradley. I'm a computer scientist who believes that pixels are too.</p>

Making things is what I do. In 2016, I graduated from [Taylor University](http://taylor.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Science&nbsp;-&nbsp;New Media / Systems. My education integrated computer science, design, and systems analysis. Now I program stuff and do information security projects. I am passionate about building secure applications that people enjoy using. You should check out some of the [cool things I've done](/work/) or get in touch with me.

I can be contacted via [email](mailto:thatguy@bradleyrosenfeld.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bradleyrosenfeld/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BoringCode/), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bradleyrosenfeld/). If you need to contact me securely, use my [GPG public key](/assets/bradleyrosenfeld-publickey.asc). Fingerprint: `150C 68BB 3BA2 F6E8 8CE6  3E26 73D6 4308 CADA B35D`
