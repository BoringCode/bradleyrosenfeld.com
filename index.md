Hi, I'm Bradley. I'm a computer scientist who believes that pixels are people too.

Making things is what I do. In 2016, I graduated from [Taylor University](http://taylor.edu) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science &ndash; New Media / Systems. My education integrated computer science. systems analysis, and design. Now, I wander the world programing software and solving information security problems. I am passionate about building secure applications that people enjoy using. Although my interests are varied, I tend to gravitate towards the web. My experience ranges from building frontend web applications to probing backend systems for bugs and exploits. You should check out some of the [cool things I've done](/portfolio/) or get in touch with me.

I can be contacted via [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bradleyrosenfeld/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BoringCode/), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bradleyrosenfeld/). Sometimes, I post videos on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/bradleyrosenfeld/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAVTJXRxDHbsDGzxXVsJYQ). For samples of my work, go to my [Github profile](https://github.com/BoringCode/) or check out my [portfolio](/porfolio/). Want the short version?
