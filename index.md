<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Bradley. I'm a computer scientist who believes that pixels are people too.</p>

Making things is what I do. In 2016, I graduated from [Taylor University](http://taylor.edu) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science &ndash; New Media / Systems. My education integrated computer science. systems analysis, and design. Now, I program software and solve information security problems. I am passionate about building secure applications that people enjoy using. You should check out some of the [cool things I've done](/portfolio/) or get in touch with me.
